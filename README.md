# fantastic-datasets-and-where-to-find-them
A curated and assorted list of publicly available datasets for machine learning.


## Images -   
[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) - The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.  

[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) - The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.  

[CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) - This dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).   

[ImageNet](http://image-net.org/download) - ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.  

[COCO by Microsoft](http://cocodataset.org/#home) - COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.   

## Language processing -   
[text8](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip) -   
[enwik8](http://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/enwik8.zip) - The test data for the Large Text Compression Benchmark is the first 109 bytes of the English Wikipedia dump on Mar. 3, 2006.
